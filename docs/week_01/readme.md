## Definitions
**GIS** - Geographic Information Systems or Science

**Ethics** - Branch of philosphy concerned about how and why we do certain actions.

**Civil Society** - The sector of society concerned focused with non-profits and non-government. This is in opposition to the other two sectors of society, the private sector and the government sector.

**Data** - Observed units of information.

**Qualitative data** - Properties are descriptive and are not numerical. 

**Quantitative data** - Properties that are numerical.

**Cartography** - The practice of making maps, includes paper maps and digital mapmaking.

**Critical Data Studies** - More to the data than just numbers, data should be approached with skepticism and the collection of data is a set of biases

**Repository** – Place where code exists, also known as a `repo`.

**Open Source** - Programs and applications where the source is freely available for people to use and replicate.

**Closed Source** - Programs where the source is not made available for all.

**Open data**– When governments, companies, and non-profits provide data for transparency

**Humanitarian data** – When non-profits and organizations ask for data from volunteers and locals

**Crowdsource data** – A sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods or services, including ideas, voting, micro-tasks and finances, from a large, relatively open and often rapidly evolving group of participants.

**Participatory data** – Puts the community at the forefront of the data, amplifies and empowers local voices

**Cloning a repo** - Copying another repo to your own location (can be remote or local).

**Forking a repo** - Copying another repo, but it is still connected to the origin repo
 
**Class repo** – Class content and the discussion board. If you are reading this, you probably are on it!

**Lab assignment repo** – Where lab assignments will be posted at the beginning of the week.

**Your lab assignment repo** – A forked version of the  lab assignment repo, where you will be submitting assignments. The "remote" exists on GitHub and "local" exists on your machine if you cloned it. 

**Group Project repo** – where you will be submitting your group work.
