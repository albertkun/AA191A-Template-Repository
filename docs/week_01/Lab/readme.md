4. **[Lab Assignment](https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A-Assignments/tree/main/Week_01)**

Before we dive into web development and coding for the rest of the
quarter, we will begin with learning how to handle spatial data. Finding
a political campaign or social issue to address is usually the first
step and you will be doing that at the end of today’s lab after finding
your groups.

We are starting with data management because knowing how to use tools
like QGIS to handle data will form the foundations of working with data
that we will eventually be web mapping.

## [Lab Assignment](https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A-Assignments/tree/main/Week_01)
### Due Thursday 4/8:

1.  Create a new field using two fields in the `CA_Counties_2019.shp` data set or another data set of your choosing.

2. Create a geojson named `lab1.geojson` and add it to your lab assignments repository.

3. Create a new markdown file or edit the existing `lab1.md` to explain the following:
   -  What fields you used
   -  Why you used these fields
   -  What problems could the data set have
4. Commit both `lab1.geojson` and `lab1.md` to your lab assignments repository.
5. Fill out this form so I can associate you with your GitHub repo: https://forms.gle/J8kebeHEd5xbGaiRA

## Group Assignment: Project Idea
### Due Thursday 4/8:
1. Have one person create a new repo for the group.
- [Guide on how to create a new repo and invite](../../Guides/git_creating.md) 
2. Add a `readme.md` to the repository that describes the following:
   - What social problem is being addressed, - The local community or non-profit that is being empowered by your application
   - What problems you think may arise in developing this application (both technical and ethical).
   > Note: This is your group's introduction to the world, make sure you use [Markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to style your content properly.  
3. Add your group name and repo link to the Google Sheet here: 
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B5QTtB3iDFuOXT3z6kv1Dwr1eNku9AeVAHF55YEZXFs/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B5QTtB3iDFuOXT3z6kv1Dwr1eNku9AeVAHF55YEZXFs/edit#gid=0)

**Extra Credit**: Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and incorporate them into the write-up.
